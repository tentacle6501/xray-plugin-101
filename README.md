# xray-plugin-101

A minimal, from-scratch guide to writing plugins for the **XRAY PROJECT** server
extension (S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky multiplayer, `xrCPU_Pipe.dll`). Two small,
complete example plugins plus the three headers you need to build your own.

This is deliberately narrow: no game balance, no server config, no player data —
just "how does a plugin attach to the server and do something."

## What a plugin actually is

A plugin is a **PE32 x86 DLL**, written in x86 assembly and assembled with
[FASM](https://flatassembler.net/) (the Flat Assembler), then renamed with a
`.plugin` extension. The server loads every `.plugin` file it finds **directly
in its `bin/` folder** — not in a subfolder — at startup. There is no plugin
manifest and no load order guarantee beyond "whatever's in `bin/` gets loaded."

```
your_plugin.asm  --[fasm]-->  your_plugin.plugin  --[copy into server's bin/]-->  loaded
```

## Building

FASM is free but not included here (get it from flatassembler.net). On Linux/macOS,
run it through `wine`:

```bash
wine /path/to/FASM.EXE examples/welcome.asm  welcome.plugin
wine /path/to/FASM.EXE examples/teleport.asm teleport.plugin
```

On Windows, just run `FASM.EXE examples\welcome.asm welcome.plugin` directly — no
wine needed, and this is the friendlier way to iterate if you're building
interactively rather than scripting it.

Both examples `include` the three files under `include/` (`kglobals.inc` for the
`iglobal`/`uglobal` macros, `macro.inc` for generic FASM helpers, `xrproc.inc` for
the game's own API table and the `CLIENTCLASS` struct layout — this is the part
that actually lets a plugin call back into the server). Keep the relative path
(`examples/*.asm` next to `include/*.inc`) or fix the `include` lines at the top.

## The two examples

- **`examples/welcome.asm`** — the simplest possible plugin. A timer fires every
  5 seconds, tracks which of the 64 client slots hold a *new* connection, and
  sends that player a one-time welcome message 90 seconds after they join. Good
  first read: it shows the minimum shape (`DllEntryPoint`, registering a timer,
  per-slot state, sending a packet) with nothing else going on.

- **`examples/teleport.asm`** — one step up. Defines a 3D trigger zone, checks
  every connected player against it every tick, and teleports anyone inside it
  to a second point, with a per-slot cooldown so it doesn't fire every tick.
  Shows `CLIENTCLASS` field access, the SSE float math XRAY uses for positions,
  and a real "if X then do Y to this specific player" pattern.

## The one thing that will trip you up

**The server does not log plugin loads.** Its own log records game events
(spawns, teleports, kills, votes) but never "loaded foo.plugin" or "foo.plugin
failed to load." You cannot tell from the server log whether your plugin is
even running.

Both examples send their own debug lines through `xrCore.msg` (the game's
internal message function) tagged with a filter prefix — `[welcome]` /
`[tele]`. Watch for these with **[DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview)**
(Sysinternals, free) running alongside the server. If you don't see your
plugin's own startup line (`- [welcome] welcome_v1 loaded...`) in DebugView,
it didn't load — check that the `.plugin` file is actually sitting in `bin/`
and not one level down in a subfolder, which is the single most common mistake.

## Advanced example: the loyalty/loot plugin

`advanced/_spawn_v6_sanitized.asm` + `advanced/_spawn_v6_spec.md` — a sanitized copy of the
live server's actual loot plugin: a priority-ordered list of player roles, each with its own
armor-tier odds and bonus items, plus a faction-name detector. Same dispatch logic and odds as
production; every real nickname replaced with a placeholder. The spec walks through the whole
thing, including a couple of open questions about the balance and one latent array-bounds limit
that's worth knowing about before raising the player cap.

## Community and player reference

- [`docs/multiplayer-manual.md`](docs/multiplayer-manual.md) explains vanilla Deathmatch,
  the historical Hardmatch respawn layer, the retained weapon/outfit catalogue, and the
  difference between documented behavior and a live-server promise.
- [`docs/rest-bridge-ideas.md`](docs/rest-bridge-ideas.md) maps safe future integration with
  a site, player cabinet, Telegram, Discord, operator tools, and an LLM assistant. It keeps
  REST and inbound-command ideas explicitly separate from proven plugin capabilities.

### A gotcha specific to building on Linux, not covered above

Native Linux `fasm` (the `fasm` apt package, no wine needed) resolves nested `include`
directives from the vendor's `WIN32AX.INC` chain relative to the **top-level source file's own
directory**, not relative to each include file's own location — and the vendor's include tree
uses lowercase paths (`macro/struct.inc`) for files that are actually uppercase on disk
(`MACRO/STRUCT.INC`). On Windows this is invisible (NTFS/FAT are case-insensitive); on Linux it
just fails with "file not found." Symlinking the needed subfolders (`macro/`, `api/`,
`equates/`) next to your `.asm`, with lowercase-aliased filenames pointing at the real
uppercase ones, is the workaround used to build both examples in this repo.
